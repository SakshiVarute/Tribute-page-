    <h2>About Shivaji Maharaj</h2>

    <p>
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was not just a warrior king, but a visionary leader
        who laid the foundation of a strong and just kingdom.  
        He believed in courage, intelligence, and respect for all religions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Born in the hill fort of Shivneri, Shivaji Maharaj grew up learning the values of
        freedom, discipline, and self-rule. These values later became the soul of the
        Maratha Empire.
